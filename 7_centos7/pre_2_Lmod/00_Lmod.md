# Installing Lmod (module based on Lua language)

Lmod is the a dependency for the easybuild software. It should be installed maually.

## requires:

* Sudo previlage is required.

## Instructions

* On `CentOS 7` the latest `Lmod` can be installed using.

```bash
sudo yum install Lmod -y
```

* On `CentOS 8` installing Lmod using repos will fail (amid dependency issue). So it is necessary to install the Lmod manually using one of the two options...
  1. installing using the provided RPM files.
  1. installing by compiling from the source files.

* On `Ubuntu` the provided package by ubuntu repositories is far outdated therefore not compatible with the EasyBuild. The only option on ubuntu system is to build the Lmod from the source files.

## Installation procedure using provided RPM files

You should install `lua` and `Lmod` RPM files with the following steps...

1- [Setup the local repo.](https://teamnhpcc.iut.ac.ir:8081/software-installation-instructions/-/wiki/Software+installation+instructions/Local+Yum+package+server)

2- Install the Lmod and its dependencies by:

```bash
sudo yum install Lmod-7.3.x86_64
```

3- make a soft link for lua executable in the bin directory.

```bash 
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/
sudo ln -s /opt/software/Lua/5.1.4-8/bin/lua /usr/local/bin/
```
**Note:** `/opt/software/` is the default directory for the software installations. You can change it if you have relocated the packages.

At this point `lua -v` should show the lua version. 

```bash
$ lua -v
Lua 5.1.4.7-rtm  Copyright (C) 1994-2008 Lua.org, PUC-Rio
```
4- The `profile` file is the Lmod initialization script for the `bash` and `zsh` shells, the `cshrc` file is for `tcsh` and `csh` shells, and the `profile.fish` file is for the `fish` shell. Please copy or link the `profile` and `cshrc` files to `/etc/profile.d`, and optionally the `fish` file to `/etc/fish/conf.d`:

```bash
sudo ln -s /opt/software/Lmod/7.3/lmod/lmod/init/profile /etc/profile.d/z00_lmod.sh
sudo ln -s /opt/software/Lmod/7.3/lmod/lmod/init/cshrc /etc/profile.d/z00_lmod.csh
sudo ln -s /opt/software/Lmod/7.3/lmod/lmod/init/cshrc /etc/fish/conf.d/z00_lmod.fish # Optional
```
5- login as user (via `bash` command or opening a new terminal). The `module` command should be set and `MODULEPATH` should be defined.

```bash
$ type module
module () 
{ 
    eval $($LMOD_CMD bash "$@");
    [ $? = 0 ] && eval $(${LMOD_SETTARG_CMD:-:} -s sh)
}
```

6- For integrating module command into users' shells 

**Note:** I could make these process automated by the packages themselves but, since the specification for different machine configurations on HPCs was different I decided to keep the installation as general as possible. Insted I have provided some bash files that will do these processes automatically.

**Bash example:**

On login, the bash shell first reads `/etc/profile`, and if `profiles.d` is activated, that in turn should source all the `*.sh` files in `/etc/profile.d` with something like:

```bash
if [ -d /etc/profile.d ]; then
  for i in /etc/profile.d/*.sh; do
    if [ -r $i ]; then
      . $i
    fi
  done
fi
```

Similarly, the system BASHRC file should source all the `*.sh` files in `/etc/profile.d` as well. Here is where things can get complicated. Please refer to the please refer to the [documentation section (Integrating module Into Usersâ€™ Shells)](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_installing.html) for details.

## Installation procedure using source files

Use the provided scripts to install lua and Lmod sutable for your OS. 

**Notes1** At the beggining of each script there are a couple of variables pointing to the location of the source files and the prefix of the installation. change them accordingly.

```bash
local_installation_prefix=/opt/software
local_sources_dir=~/.local/easybuild/sources/
```

**note2** The script tries to download the required sources from theire web pages if it doesn't find them in the provided address. Yet do to the sanctions its try may fail.

## Adding module path

Lmod will look for modules in the `MODULEPATH` directories. The `MODULEPATH` can be modified by one of the following methods. 

1- using `module use` command. 

**e.g.:**

```bash
module use /opt/modules/all
```

In this method user can also use the `unuse` command to delete any path from the `MODULEPATH`.

The downside of this method is that users must type this command every time they open a new terminal. 

2- using `MODULEPATH` variable. 

Users can modify `MODULEPATH` variable in their `.bashrc` or whatever terminal they use.

**Bash example:**

Adding this line to the `.bashrc` file will do the job.

```bash
MODULEPATH=$MODULEPATH:/opt/modules/all
```

**NOTE:** please be advised that `/opt/modules/all` is the path in which the modules will be located by default.
